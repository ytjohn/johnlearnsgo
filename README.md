John Learns Go
==============

This is a repo of me learning go. I plan to be doing:

* [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/)
* [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/)

Plus maybe some experimental fun code.

A word of caution. I'll be posting my learn as I go solutions here, this is sort of a catch-all repo, not a best 
practices repo. Also, if you're trying to do the lessons yourself, you probably shouldn't be looking in here for the
answers, because it's all about the journey.
